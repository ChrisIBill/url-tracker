## About
An application that acts as a URL shortener and tracker. It takes a URL as input from the user, from which a new shortened URL that is generated will be redirected to. When visiting the new shortened URL, tracking data such as location and device information from each unique session is gathered and stored in a visit log which can be viewed from the tracking URL. Users can choose to edit and update their URLs, creating unique and custom paths and/or changing the original URL.
